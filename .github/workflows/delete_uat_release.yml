  # This job is replicating the same thing as the above job. Adding a condition in so that the `pull_request` workflow runs when the PR merges, if not caught when the PR closes.
  # As per this documentation https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#running-your-pull_request-workflow-when-a-pull-request-merges
  # Have had some instances when the job runs but the UAT pod still exists.
