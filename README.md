### Initial setup

Git-crypt is used for encryption. It uses either your personal public key or a symmetric key.

To obtain the symmetric key you will need to get access to LastPass. Liase with a team member for this. Once you have the the key you can unlock:

    git-crypt unlock path-to-symmetric-key

### Sentry

Sentry is a realtime application monitoring and error tracking service. The service has separate monitoring for UAT/dev, Staging and Production.

New error messages can be added using the ```Sentry.capture_exception()``` or ```Sentry.capture_message()``` methods:
```
def test_sentry
  begin
    1 / 0
  rescue ZeroDivisionError => exception
    Sentry.capture_exception(exception)
   end
end
```
or

```Sentry.capture_message("This is the error message that is sent to Sentry")```

### Feature flags

We use Flipper to manage feature flags.
While our flagging requirements are simple we set desired flag values in env vars and transfer them to Flipper's file-based data store in an initializer.
To add a new feature flag, set a `"#{flag_name.upcase}_FEATURE_FLAG"` env var in all environments where you want the flag enabled.
Then add `flag_name` to the list of flags Flipper should read from in `config/initializers/flipper.rb`.

To use the feature flag in your code, just call `Flipper.enabled?(:flag_name)`.

In tests, you can temporarily enable a feature flag with `Flipper.enable(:flag_name)`.
However, flags are _not_ reset between specs, so to avoid polluting other tests use an `around` block and call `Flipper.disable(:flag_name)` once the test has run.

### Deploying to UAT/Staging/Production

The service uses `helm` to deploy to Cloud Platform Environments via CircleCI. This can be installed using:

`brew install helm`

To view helm deployments in a namespace the command is:

`helm -n <namespace> ls --all`

e.g. `helm -n laa-estimate-financial-eligibility-for-legal-aid-uat ls --all`

Deployments can be deleted by running:

`helm delete <name-of-deployment>`

e.g. `helm -n laa-estimate-financial-eligibility-for-legal-aid-uat delete el-351-employment-questions-pa`

It is also possible to manually deploy to an environment from the command line, the structure of the command can be found in `bin/uat_deployment`
