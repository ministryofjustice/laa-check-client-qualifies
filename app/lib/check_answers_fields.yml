# This file defines the fields to show on the 'check answers' page,
# since that page mostly comprises a bunch of very repetitive
# line items that only vary in terms of what particular attribute is being summarised.

# This file also contains some very simple rules around when _not_ to show a particular field.
# Note that it doesn't comment on rules around which sections and subsections to skip, as
# that is determined by the StepsHelper logic.

# DATA TYPES:
# ==========

# SECTIONS
# A section always has a label, which is used to construct the I18n key for its title.
# It has a screen IF the section header should have a 'change' link to that screen next to it.
# It also has zero or more subsections

# SUBSECTIONS
# A subsection has a label IF it has a visible title
# It has a screen IF the subsection header should have a 'change' link to that screen next to it.
# It also has zero or more fields


# FIELDS
# A field has a type, which is one of boolean, money, select, number or money_with_frequency.
# This determines which partial is rendered
# It has an attribute, which determines the key used to store the relevant value in the session
# The attribute is also used to construct the I18n key
# It has a screen IF the field has its own 'change' link to a screen
# 'money_with_frequency' fields also have an 'alt_attribute' which describes
# which number to display.
# It can have a 'requires_inclusion_in', which defines which array attribute in the session
# needs to contain the inclusion string (see below) as a string if the value of the field is to be displayed
# It can have a 'requires_inclusion_of', which defines the inclusion string. If requires_inclusion_of
# is not defined, the inclusion string is the attribute name
# It can have a 'skip_if_null' attribute, if the line should be hidden depending on whether or
# not there is a displayable value.
