# This details a list of screens divided into sections.
# Both screens and sections can detail conditions (skip_if, skip_unless) that
# cause them and any children they have to be skipped, with those conditions
# corresponding to attributes on the Estimate model.
# Sections can have children, comprising sections and/or screens
# Sections can also have a check_answer_group boolean which, if set,
# means that in the check answer flow, all child screens of that section
# should form a mini-loop.
