# the user has entered for the client's gross income IF the client is employed AND
# does not receive a passporting benefit AND does not receive Asylum Support.

# The methods to call are not defined explicitly, but rather are inferred using the
# `method_missing` method, in which method calls are delegated to the appropriate
# form object but only if the form is associated with a valid step in the flow.
