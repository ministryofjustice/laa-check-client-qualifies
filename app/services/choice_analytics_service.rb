    # is in the URL so also in the application logs, so is stored alongside the
    # user's IP address. We don't in general want to store any more information
    # in our analytics data than is also available in the application logs.

    # There are rare and specific exceptions around choices that users make
    # that are (a) important to build meaningful metrics from our analytics data
    # and (b) not information that is in any way sensitive. This service
    # exists to create analytics data from those rare and specific choices
