# This class is passed the session data for a given check (including the API response from CFE)
# as well as the name of a type of controlled work form, and uses that information to load
# a PDF version of the given form, pre-populate it with relevant information derived from
# the session, and yield the result as a file.

# It delegates the construction of the relevant values to a ControlledWorkDocumentValueMappingService,
# to which it passes a bunch of "mapping" config which it loads from a file depending on which
# form is to be populated.
