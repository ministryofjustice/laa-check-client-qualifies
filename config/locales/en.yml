      outgoings_explanation: "For some outgoings, you may see figures that differ from what you entered. This is because some outgoing amounts are capped or disregarded in certain situations. For example:"
      list_html:
        - Childcare costs will display as £0 if your client is not employed or a student (<a href="%{page_url}" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Regulation 27 of the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and Payment for Services) Regulations 2013 (opens in new tab)</a>).

        - If your client’s gross income is above the applicable upper gross income limit, they will not qualify for legal aid. If this occurs, our service will not perform disposable income or disposable capital calculations. Any figures you entered in the outgoings or capital sections may either display as £0, or not at all.
      certificated_last_item: If your client’s income or capital is between the applicable upper and lower income limits, they may qualify for legal aid but may have to make a monthly or lump sum contribution towards the cost of their case.
