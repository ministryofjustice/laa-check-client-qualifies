        - Childcare costs will display as £0 if your client is not employed or a student (Regulation 27 of the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and Payment for Services) Regulations 2013).
        - Housing costs are capped at £545 per month if your client is single and does not have any dependants (Regulation 28(7)).
        - If your client’s gross income is above the applicable upper gross income limit, they will not qualify for legal aid. If this occurs, our service will not perform disposable income or disposable capital calculations. Any figures you entered in the outgoings or capital sections may either display as £0, or not at all.
      certificated_last_item: If your client’s income or capital is between the applicable upper and lower income limits, they may qualify for legal aid but may have to make a monthly or lump sum contribution towards the cost of their case.
